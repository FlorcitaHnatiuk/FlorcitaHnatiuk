### Hi there, I'm Flor! ğŸ‘‹
    A baby web dev! 

** ğŸ¥° Thank you for being here! I hope my learning process continues improving day by day. Here you'll have access to my proyects and ideas.

** ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a proyect based mainly in JS.

** ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying to become a fullstack web developer at Coderhouse. I finished the first of four steps in my career. The proyect was Universe, please take a look at it! 

** ğŸ“« If you have any ideas you want to share please write me! flopi.hnatiuk@gmail.com

** âš¡ Fun fact: I can't believe how much I fell in love with programming ğŸ’˜. I started coding during the pandemic and I thought it was impossible for me and that in fact I wouldn't like it. And here I am! after almost an year I continue studying ğŸ¤“ and I'm looking for my first IT experience.
